			<div class="col-5"><span>Originally published as a three-volume novel on January 1, 1818, Frankenstein had its notorious beginnings as a now lost ur-story written by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley (MWS) in the summer of 1816, when the Shelleys and Claire Clairmont joined Lord Byron and his physician John Polidori in Cologny, near Geneva. During that historically cold and rainy summer, the group amused themselves during the evenings by reading ghost stories aloud, prompting Byron to propose that they each attempt to write one.
				
				MWS’s own original story and further early drafts are no longer extant. She recast this early work, with the collaboration of Percy B. Shelley (PBS), into the draft of a two-volume novel in 1816-1817. In doing so, she used two notebooks (A and B) whose disbound pages survive as Bodleian MS Abinger c.56 and c.57. Complicating the textual condition of the draft material: the division of pages between Notebooks A and B does not correspond with their disbound form as manuscripts c.56 and c.57</span></div>
